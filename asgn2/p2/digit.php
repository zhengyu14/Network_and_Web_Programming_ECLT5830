  TODO:
  1. Retrieve the value of a digit and the type of digit from the request

  For this problem, you may assume the two values are always valid.

  Note: # in the following file names represent the value of the digit.

  If type of digit is 1, output image "img/#CB.jpg".
  If type of digit is 2, output image "img/#ODB.jpg"
  If type of digit is 3, output image "img/#UNO.jpg"

  Note:
  You need to set a header field and use readfile() to output the
  content of a file. Here, output means sending the data to the response body.
